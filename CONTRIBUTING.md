# Notes for candidates

This repository is intentionally small and intentionally imperfect.

You're encouraged to:
- Add logging / guardrails where it helps
- Improve safety and test coverage
- Document your reasoning and next steps in RUNBOOK.md / INCIDENT.md / TICKET.md

Please keep fixes minimal and well-explained.
