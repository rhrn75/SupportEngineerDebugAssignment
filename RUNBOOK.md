# Runbook — SupportEngineerChallenge

> Update this file as part of the exercise.

## Service overview
- **Service:** SupportEngineerChallenge.Api
- **Purpose:** Minimal task tracker (create + list tasks)
- **Data store:** SQLite (`app.db` in the API working directory)

## Common commands

**Run locally**
```bashtest
cd src/SupportEngineerChallenge.Api
dotnet run
```

**Run tests**
```bash
dotnet test
```

## Key endpoints
- `GET /api/tasks?userId={id}&limit={n}`
- `POST /api/tasks`

## Troubleshooting checklist (starter)

### “Create task fails with 500”
- Check API logs in console.
- Verify request payload and headers.
- Look for unhandled exceptions in `POST /api/tasks`.

### “Tasks list is slow”
- Confirm dataset size (seed can be large).
- Inspect how the list endpoint fetches and filters data.
- Review query patterns and database usage.

### “Duplicates / wrong order after refresh”
- Compare API response vs UI rendering.
- Check the UI state update logic during refresh.
- Verify how the list is merged and ordered.

## Verification steps (starter)
- Create tasks from UI and via Swagger.
- Refresh tasks repeatedly; confirm no duplicates and ordering is correct.
- Validate list endpoint returns only requested user's tasks.

## Rollback / mitigation ideas (starter)
- Roll back to last known good version.
- Temporarily disable problematic client behavior (feature flag / UI change).
- Add guardrails (e.g. input validation, error handling) to prevent unhandled exceptions.
