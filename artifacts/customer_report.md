# Customer Reports (Context)

## Report 1 — Create task 500s
> “I click **Add** and sometimes it just errors. If I try again a few seconds later it works.”

## Report 2 — Slow lists
> “My task list takes a long time to load. My coworker says it’s fine.”

## Report 3 — Duplicates / ordering weirdness
> “After I refresh, some tasks show up twice. Also the order looks random sometimes.”

Notes:
- We don't have perfect reproduction steps.
- Assume this is an app with multiple users, and some have a lot of tasks.
