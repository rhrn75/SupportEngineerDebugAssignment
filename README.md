# Support Engineer Challenge — Debug & Stabilize

This repo contains a small prebuilt app with a few realistic "production" issues. Your goal is to **triage**, **diagnose**, and **ship safe fixes** with clear communication.

## Scenario

Assume this app is running in production and you're on-call. We’ve received customer reports:

1) “Sometimes creating a task fails with a 500.”
2) “The tasks list is slow for some users.”
3) “We’ve seen tasks appear duplicated or out of order after refresh.”

Not all reports may be accurate — part of the exercise is determining what’s real, what’s reproducible, and what you’d do next.

## What’s here

- `src/SupportEngineerChallenge.Api` — .NET 8 minimal API + SQLite + static UI
- `tests/SupportEngineerChallenge.Tests` — xUnit tests (some may fail)
- `RUNBOOK.md` — **you will update**
- `INCIDENT.md` — **you will fill in**
- `TICKET.md` — **you will write a follow-up ticket**
- `artifacts/` — sample logs + incident report context

## Timebox

Aim for ~2–4 hours. If you go beyond that, please note it.

## Getting started

Requirements:
- .NET SDK 8.x

Run the API + UI:

```bash
cd src/SupportEngineerChallenge.Api
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

Then open:
- API Swagger: http://localhost:5088/swagger
- UI:         http://localhost:5088/

Run tests:

```bash
dotnet test
```

## Deliverables

Please complete:

1. **Triage & reproduction**  
   - Clear repro steps for each confirmed issue
   - Capture evidence (logs, stack traces, etc.)

2. **Root cause analysis**  
   - Explain what’s happening and why (briefly)

3. **Fixes**  
   - Safe, minimal fixes
   - Add/update tests where appropriate

4. **Operational thinking**  
   - Update `RUNBOOK.md` with diagnosis + verification + rollback/mitigation steps

5. **Incident summary**  
   - Fill in `INCIDENT.md` with impact/timeline/root cause/fix/follow-ups

6. **Follow-up ticket**  
   - Write `TICKET.md` with a high-quality ticket (acceptance criteria, priority, etc.)

## Notes

- You can change anything in this repo (including UI) as long as you explain your choices.
- If you get blocked by setup, write down what you tried and where you got stuck.
